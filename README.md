# Better-schedule-builder
Given a "graph" of classes to take for your degree at university, how can we optimize the order in which you take classes?

## Short-term
+ Complete the helpers.py program
+ and the validate_schedule.py program (using topological sort)

## Medium-term
+ Devise some "score function"(s) that we can use as metrics for schedule efficiency/goodness/easiness/hardness/etc
  + i.e. what do you want your "perfect schedule" to be?
+ Find solutions to one or some of those optimization problems

## Long-term
+ Draw from SIS / Lou's List to avoid typing out majors
+ make an app that shows results rather than typing out majors/courses (super long-term)
